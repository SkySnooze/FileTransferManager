#Anantakeat UTAC : Exercise Develop an application ( Java )

Java-based application for file transfer management. Please see the detailed requirements below.

â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚The submission deadline is **July 18, 2025 at 6:00 PM**.
 

ðŸ”§ Functional Requirements:

Monitor Source Folder (Folder A):

â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚- The application should check for new files in Folder A.

Exclude .temp Files:

â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚- Any file with the .temp extension must be ignored and not processed.

Compress Files Before Transfer:

â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚- Each file must be compressed into a .zip file before being transferred to Folder B.

Compare File Size After Compression:

â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚- After compression, check the size of the .zip file in Folder B.

â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚- If the size is different from the original file in Folder A, do not transfer the file and keep it in Folder A.

Move Original File to Backup Folder:

â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚- If the transfer is successful, move the original file from Folder A to a Backup folder.

Run the Application Every 1 Minute:

â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚- Schedule the application to run automatically every 1 minute (e.g., using a Java timer, scheduled task, or cron job).

Prevent Duplicate Execution:

â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚- Before starting a new process, check whether the previous instance of the application is still running.

â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚- If it is, skip the current run to avoid overlapping executions.

 

ðŸ“¦ Deliverables:

Flowchart Diagram:

â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚- A visual flowchart of the application process in either Excel or PowerPoint format.

Java Source Code:

â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚- Well-structured and commented source code in Java.

Result Summary:

â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚- A simple summary of the execution results, e.g., which files were transferred, skipped, or failed (in .txt format).

Event Log Record:

â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚- A log file that records key events such as start time, end time, files processed, errors encountered, etc. (in .txt format).
